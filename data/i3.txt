Fine-tuning involves updating the weights of some or all layers of the pre-trained

model to adapt it to the new task.

The idea may appear similar to transfer learning, but in fine-tuning, we typically

do not replace the last few layers of the pre-trained network.

Instead, the pretrained model itself is adjusted to the new data.
